* high performance FILE CONVERSIONS
* LICENCE HANDLING
* solr and memcachedb UPDATES


## Disclaimers

Most of the software here is work-in-progress.

With project AI UBL tries to act like a startup in a corporate
environment, which is a nice contradiction.

The dependency graph is the overall structure, that allow us to build
complex workflows.

The python project is called [siskin](https://github.com/miku/siskin).

It's on pypi, you can install it with:

```sh
$ pip install siskin
```
