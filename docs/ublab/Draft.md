# Organizing data workflows with luigi

## Notes

* a soup of tasks that try to make some bibliographic data artifacts reproducible
* define a bunch of steps (e.g. download data, conversion, grouping, filtering, ...) and allow these steps to be executed at given
* specific to requirements of project, so not really reusable
* the framework behind siskin is more interesting and may be more usable for data science tasks in general
* comparison to alternatives like airflow, pachyderm and dvc
