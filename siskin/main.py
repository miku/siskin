Entry points should replace scripts in the future. Currently we use a mix of
bash and Python for executables and console_scripts - with bash not being cross
platform anyway.

TODO(miku): Consider moving to a single entry point, e.g. "siskin" with
subcommands implemented by separate scripts.

from siskin import __version__


def main():
    print("siskin %s" % __version__)
    print()
    print("For now, please use the functions listed here: https://is.gd/nfAGIP")
